            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:136902:3"/> hath raiſed up ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> as is every way qualified to do his Work, by a ſingle eye to God's Glory, and an active Zeal for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſin: Witneſs his Majeſties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Lord Biſhop of London;</hi> where, after his Majeſties Order to the Clergy for Preacbing frequently againſt thoſe particular Sins and Vices which are moſt prevailing in this Realm, <hi>&amp;c. And whereas there is as yet no ſufficient Proviſion by any Statute-Law for the puniſhing of Fornication and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that all Church-Wardens preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially all thoſe that are guilty of any ſuch Crimes in their ſeveral Pariſhes; and upon ſuch Preſentments, we require you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without delay, and upon ſufficient Proof to inflict the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is not enough with our moſt Religious Prince to ſee our Church reſcued from Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Popery, unleſs it be alſo purged from theſe foul ſpots and groſs ſcandals: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could not hear of any particular piece on this ſubject, this was the firſt Motive to me to write, from the need of ſuch Tracts. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive to write, was a compaſſionate concern for ſome <hi>particular perſons who had fallen this way,</hi> and an earneſt deſire to help them forward in their Repentance, ſo neceſſary a Duty that they are loſt and undone for ever without it; and ſo acceptable, that the
<pb facs="tcp:136902:4"/> Angels in Heaven (to whom the filthy Luſts of Men are a great offence and annoyance) rejoyce over one ſinner that repenteth: And he who truly repenteth, by his Repentance is reſtored to all the Dignities of the Sons of God, which were loſt by ſin; and <hi>Ezek. 18. 22. All his Tranſgreſſions that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him, in his Righteouſneſs that he hath done, he ſhall live:</hi> So that no mention being made of <hi>his former Iniquities,</hi> his Name ſhall be had in remembrance with God (and with men too it ought by conſequence) <hi>as if he had not fallen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I hope the World will have ſo much <hi>Charity for me,</hi> as to believe that I make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to practiſe my ſelf what I preach to others; and that though I cannot ſhine among the pureſt lights, yet, <hi>ſi feneſtratum pectus,</hi> if <hi>my Breaſt had Windows, that men could ſee thorough it into my heart,</hi> they would find there, that I take more delight in doing any good for God and the Church of God, than the Worldling doth in that which brings him in his greateſt gain, or the Ambitious man in his Honours and Preferments, or the <hi>voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Epicure</hi> in his ſenſual <hi>Embraces;</hi> and that I differ as much as light and darkneſs from that Nobleman whom <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of, ſo wretchedly enſlaved to this ſin of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb facs="tcp:136902:4"/> that he was not aſhamed to ſay, that if he might live for ever, and be carried from one Stews to another, <hi>he would deſire no other Heaven.</hi> Though I carry not ſo <hi>great a Figure</hi> in the World as others, yet I may have an heart as full of a pious Zeal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Peace and Holineſs, (which conſiſts in the Purification of Heart and Life) and the end of that man will be peace, though he may have but little peace until then, through the envy, hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and though he ſee not that Purity and Reformation in the Church, nor a difference between the <hi>clean and the unclean,</hi> yet he is ſure to ſee God in thoſe Manſions above, inhabited only by the pure in heart, which ſhut out whatſoever defileth or is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here malicious wicked perſons may load us with Reproach and Infamy, and repreſent us amongſt the vileſt of men, they may throw dirt ſtoutly, (as the Proverb ſuggeſts, (and I have found it true) <hi>Calumniare, fortiter &amp; haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit)</hi> and it will ſtick ſomewhere; and in ſuch a Caſe, though we ought not to be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned at it, yet neither ought we to be over ſolicitous about our own good Names, but to do our Maſter's Work faithfully, and truſt in him that he will clear the Integrity of his Servants, and bring forth their Righteouſneſs as the light; or however, if we be not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

And thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature looks upon mortifying the fleſhly luſts as a ſore evil; it puts the fleſh to a great deal of pain and miſery; it afflicts the Body in denying it ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, croſſing it in its ſinful deſires, its evil luſtings, and therefore it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture to the plucking out a right Eye, to the cutting off a right Hand, or a right Foot, and caſting it from one; ſo difficult is it for a man to deny himſelf herein, in the Mortification of his darling Luſt.</p>
               <p>This, to <hi>mortifie your members,</hi> &amp;c. (ſaith one of the Fathers,) is the hardeſt Text in the whole Bible, and the hardeſt Duty in Chriſtianity that we can go about.

This is Mortification, or the giving a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound to ſin, even as a man is ſaid to be a dead man when he is mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or when he is inwardly decayed as to his vital parts, or the breaking ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Vein in the Body, albeit in ſome ſuch caſes they have ſome remainder of life, and that may continue ſometimes years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or as when the main Body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is routed and beaten out of field, or dead upon the place, though there may be ſome ſtriving and ſtrugling, or faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the remainder, yet it doth not hinder them from the Victory: Even ſo it is here, when the main Body of ſin is ſubdued and beaten out of the Heart of a Chriſtian, though there be ſome <hi>Reliquiae</hi> or remainders of corruption, yet ſin is mortified; for this mortifying work i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Upon farther ſearch, he found the Stone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, not only the perfect ſhape, but alſo the colour of every part of the man and the Beaſt, with the Sinews, Veins, Eyes, Mouths, in ſuch a lively manner, that he was convinced of the truth of it, and was told, that ſome who had laboured to carry from thence that Monument of mans ſhameful Luſt, either their perſons

               <p>Next come <hi>inordinate Affection,</hi> and <hi>evil Concupiſcence</hi> to be conſidered, which reſpect the luſts of men as they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, though they never break forth into acts of naughtineſs. Some conceive <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to be a general unlimited word, that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto all particular ſinful affections, deſires and inclinations of the heart, all ſuch as are diſorderly, againſt the dictates of right Reaſon, or the Word of God.</p>
               <p>The word indeed may comprehend any violent ſtrong paſſion; but ſo it is beſides my diſcourſe: I ſhall take it in the other ſence, for the paſſion of Love or Luſt; for it is ſpoken of here in an ill ſenſe, as that which is to be mortified, as <hi>Amnons</hi> paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the fury of which paſſion preyed upon his vital Spirits, ſo that he waxed lean from day to day. When a mans paſſion is ſo mighty ſtrong towards any Creature, and ungovernable, it argues that our love to God is weak. For when our affection is carried out after him, it will be predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:136902:19"/> and take off our inordinate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive affection to the Creature, ſo that it ſhall not continue long uncontroulable. Elſe the word may ſignifie ſuch an habit of corrupt affection, as is in thoſe who are given over to laſciviouſneſs; ſuch a luſtful diſpoſition as is affected upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every occaſion or temptation; and hence <hi>Pathici vocantur molles &amp; effeminati,</hi> (ſays <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place) <hi>quales fure Sardanapalus &amp; Heliogabalus:</hi> Such as are weak this way, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in reſpect of Women: Of which Prince, ſaith an eminent Writer, <hi>our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt kindneſs to him will be to forget him,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God cauſe us to remember him, and his ſins of this ſort by ſome remarkable Judgment; as the ſins of <hi>Manaſſah</hi> were remembred afterwards in the days of good King <hi>Joſiah.</hi> Our way to mortiſie this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, will be to beg the Holy Spirit to cleanſe our hearts, and to expell the evil habit, and to poſſeſs and dwell in our hearts, that ſo corrupt affections may not ſtir; and to ſet our affections upon the right Object, even Almighty God, and then they will be fixed, and like the Houſe that was founded upon a Rock, ſtand firm, and not be moved or ſhaken with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which argues great lightneſs and

               <p>Next comes <gap reason="foreign">

Commandment, comprehending all thoſe irregular Appetites and evil Deſires which proceed from that Luſt within, which is ſet as the Fountain of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſpecially of uncleanneſs; and ſo in St. <hi>James, ch.</hi> 1. 14. the word is tranſlated <hi>Luſt</hi> there, and Concupiſcence, according to the original of the word; being a Latin word, ſignifies more eſpecially <hi>Conjunctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis appetitus,</hi> a deſire to be together, or a deſire after carnal copulation; and in this latter ſence, ſhall I uſe the word for the Luſt of uncleanneſs, the internal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſort. The Original Impurity of our hearts, or naughtineſs that is in them naturally, that gives birth and being to evil motions, and is as the Mother-ſin to them, the Luſt which conceiveth them, when tempting objects preſent themſelves,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136902:20"/> or upon the reading or hearing of any laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious ſpeeches, or in the heat of Summer, or upon ſundry other occaſions, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſuggeſtions of Satan. Theſe are of two ſorts, either filthy Thoughts and Imaginations concerning uncleanneſs, in the Acts of it, or the Circumſtances; or thoſe things which have any concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or relation to them, whatever may ſtir up Luſt in us: theſe muſt be mortified, we muſt reject them at the firſt motion, caſt them out as ſoon as Satan caſts them in, turn away from thoſe objects which preſent theſe corrupting fancies to us; take off our thoughts, and fix them upon ſomewhat elſe, fall into diſcourſe when you have company with you, and divert your ſelf ſome way or other to chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theſe Imps of the unclean Spirit; or if you are alone, with ſome place of Scripture, or with a Prayer in this time of Temptation, if they be very urgent and powerful, and preſſing upon you, for then Satan, he is in them, working and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them home.</p>
               <p>Next come actual Deſires or Luſts, not only after Whoredom or Adultery, but all laſcivious touches, or the company of ſuch perſons, or after their wanton Wit, or any of thoſe things which afford enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:136902:20"/> to the Luſts of men. I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe latter, evil Deſires (as ariſing from the will,) from evil thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the mind, a thinking faculty. To mortifie theſe deſires, Firſt, By a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſire and endeavour to ſerve God with a pure heart here, and with the pure in heart to ſee God and enjoy him for ever hereafter: if this deſire were but ſtrong and vehement, if this deſire were but rooted and ſettled in the heart, and that betimes, or indeed if the heart were but ſeaſoned with grace, it would work out unchaſt deſires, or bring them under in ſubjection of the fleſh to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Next, when the heart is purged, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Spiritual things above the pleaſures of ſin; refer it to God, deſire of God to chooſe for thee a ſingle or a Married life, as ſhall be foreſeen in his Wiſdom, to be moſt for his Glory and thine Eternal Salvation: this ſhould be every ones deſire that hath the gift of Continency; if you have not that gift, and cannot attain it, you muſt deſire after Marriage, to quench the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flaming of Luſt inwardly, though it never come to action; and thou muſt beg of God that bleſſing, pleading before him, that thou doſt not deſire Marriage for any falſe ends, of Riches, Honours, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:136902:21"/> to Indulge thy Luſt and Brutiſh Senſuality, but as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. a Remedy againſt <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> to ſubdue thy Luſts, and keep thee from any ſinful effects of them, that thou mayſt ſerve God with a more pure Heart, and that 'tis for the Salvation of thy Soul (which thou feareſt is endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thy Luſts) that thou deſireſt it, or for the begetting of Children to be brought up in the fear of the Lord; and ſeriouſly promiſe or reſolve with Gods Aſſiſtance, upon the Religious Education of thy Children, which God ſhall give thee in a married Eſtate; and then thou haſt reaſon to hope God will give thee thy Requeſt; and pray for ſuch an one as may be an help to thee Heavenwards, begging of God in the mean time Repentance for thy paſt Sins, and Grace to preſerve thee for the time to come. As for thoſe that are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, their deſires muſt be towards their Husband, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. and the Husbands towards his Wife, and be confined within the Bonds of Matrimony.</p>
               <p>But if theſe evil Motions and Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind, and of the will, be not reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and mortifyed, they will be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Complacency and Delight, they will be hugg'd and cheriſhed as the darlings and the dearly beloved, the ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136902:21"/> danties of the Soul, and ſo corrupt the Heart and Affections: there will be a pleaſing our ſelves too in the Fancy of luſt, a good liking, and a friendlineſs unto it; and as <hi>he whoſe delight is in the Law of the Lord, in his Law</hi> is ſaid to <hi>Meditate Day and Night,</hi> Pſal. 1. 2. ſo on the ſame account of our delight in theſe things, they will be our Meditation Day and Night: When Sleep departeth from us in the Night, and our reſt faileth us, this will inſinuate it ſelf into our Minds, and fill up our thoughts, and perhaps our former Sins return upon us with a contemplative uncleanneſs, and we fetch over our old Sins, with all the pleaſure that was enjoyed in them, chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſweetneſs of thoſe Sins (as <hi>Aholibah, Ezek.</hi> 23. 19, calling <hi>to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the days of her Youth,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. the <hi>lewdneſs of thy Youth,</hi> is ſaid to have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed her Whoredoms by ſo doing,) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Serious and Penitent reflection on them, with great regret and grief of mind, and loathing our ſelves for all our Abominations. Thus to repeat our Sins, muſt needs be an hainous Provocation, bring a double guilt upon us, and put us farther from Repentance than before, if not bind up the puniſhment of thoſe Sins upon us, and Seal them under Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,

If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye,</hi>) ſtand Condemned by the word of God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to eternal death: <hi>But if ye through the ſpirit do mortiſie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> When any of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholars had degenerated in their Morals, from the ſober, modeſt and vertuous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their Maſter, and let themſelves looſe to all kind of Vice, and brutiſh ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, there was ſet a Bier as for dead mens Corps in his Room, to ſignifie that the man was dead, though the Beaſt was alive.

               <p>Fourth Argument for Mortification of our Luſts, Becauſe we vowed to God and Covenanted in our Baptiſm, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſinful luſts of the Fleſh: The Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, are the enemies of our Salvation, mentioned in our Church Catechiſm, and in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. St. <hi>James, ch. 1. 4. Luſts are ſaid to War in our Members;</hi> and in 1 Epiſt. of <hi>Peter, c. 2. 11. Abſtain from fleſhly Luſts which War againſt the Soul;</hi> and the Soul muſt War againſt them for ever, renouncing all the ſinful luſts of the Fleſh, that is, diſowning, rejecting them, their motions and temptations, with an hatred and abhorrence of them in our hearts, or at leaſt ſuch a diſlike of them as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now if Covenants made in worldly matters, as Bonds and Leaſes, bind their Heirs and Succeſſours, even the Children yet unborn; ſo in Spirituals, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Covenant for their Children in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, deſiring it for their Children, and procuring others as Sureties to be bound
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:136902:27"/> with them for the greater aſſurance of the Childrens Religious Education, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Covenant Duties and Conditions, no doubt but it binds them as much in Spirituals, to ſtand to, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Religious, as well as the Civil Contracts and Covenants. And he is Perjur'd who breaks this ſolemn Vow and Covenant, that lives at peace and at friendſhip with the World or the Fleſh, loving his Luſts, without that hatred and enmity which he is bound to by Baptiſm, to ſtrive and ſtruggle with them for the Maſtery, to Watch and Pray, and uſe all good and holy means for their Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and ſo long as ye hold out this good fight of Faith, reſiſting this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemy, and praying againſt your Luſts, ſo long you keep your ground and quit your ſelves like men, and are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours if you are not Conquered, though you may not have that full Victory, that triumphant ſatisfaction in your Spirit, and that inward peace which ſome others have. But if once they work you off from Prayer, and you cannot pray againſt them, or no otherwiſe than St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> before his Converſion, <hi>Domine da caſtitatem, da Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentiam, ſed non modo,</hi> Lord give me Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, give me Continence, but not now.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:136902:28"/> If people are loth that God ſhould hear their prayers; but if they pray really, and the heart truly deſire what they pray for, ſo long it looks well, and no longer; or if a man means to make a Truce or Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms and Hoſtility for any time, during the heat of Summer, or the preſence and Company of this or that beloved Body, he throws away his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, he yields, and is overcome; and if he live in a continual Peace and League with them, and do not recover himſelf, and renew his Spiritual Warfare, he is utterly loſt and undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Fifth Argument: We muſt Mortify our Luſts, or if you will, luſtful Members, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literal ſence of the words, becauſe our Bodies are Members of Chriſt, and this Argument the Holy Ghoſt urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 15. Know ye not that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the Members of Chriſt: Shall I then take the Members of Chriſt, and make them Members of an Harlot? God forbid.</hi> I muſt ſnew in what ſence our Bodies are the Members of Chriſt; and then how that argues for Mortification of our Luſts. Chriſt and Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns are one Body, one Spiritually, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>head over all things to his Church, which is his Body, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:136902:28"/> Chriſt the Head and Fountain of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, Senſe, and Motion; and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Members of that Body, influenced, acted, and enlivened by one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Spirit, which Chriſt received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, or infinitely in perfection, that ſo he might abundantly communicate it to his Members, enabling them to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie the <hi>evil Concupiſcence</hi> in their hearts, and the Luſts of the Fleſh, that Fleſh and Blood, or Bodies of Sin which they carry about them. Now ſince there is ſuch a Spiritual Union between Chriſt and us, and we are taken into ſuch a near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Chriſt, as Members in that Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, whereof he is the Head of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; ſhould not the Members bear a Conformity to their Head? If he was pure even to perfection, ought not we to reſemble him in that Purity, by a Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Uncleanneſs? And as it is in the Marriage Office, <hi>Keep your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Members of Chriſt's body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Our Bodies are Members of Chriſt, as they are Members of the ſame Fleſh and Blood, or bodies of the ſame kind with that which Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ook upon him in the days of his Fleſh, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Hebr. 5. 7. Chap. 2. 14. For as much then as the Children are partakers
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:136902:29"/> of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo took part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſame,</hi> and ſo exalted our Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the nature of Angels, by aſſuming it, and uniting it to his Divine Nature. He was God-man, or <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And thus he honoured it in the higheſt Nature, and made it ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in that Hypoſtatical Union with the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>Again, He honoured it by the Purity of his immaculate Conception, through the power of the Holy Ghoſt, (and not after the ordinary manner of men, in their fallen and corrupt State, by a ſinful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,) and by the pure manner of his Birth, of a Virgin undefiled, and free and pure from men: The force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts herein, If Chriſt ſo highly exalted our Nature, above that of Angels, ſhall we abaſe it to the <hi>Beaſts that periſh,</hi> by living to ſenſe, and the ſinful cravings of the Fleſh? Shall we make that Fleſh vile by our Luſts (and ſo contemtpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) which the Son of God made Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by his Incarnation, and which is glorified in Chriſt as in <hi>Capite,</hi> and which we expect hereafter to be made like unto Chriſt's glorious Body? Can we expect this <hi>corruptible</hi> (ſubject to corruption, in the worſt ſence of the words,) <hi>ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:136902:29"/> put on incorruption,</hi> unleſs it put off all its corrupt Luſts before it dyes, on this ſide the grave, that ſo it might be ſit for that Inheritance which is <hi>incorruptible, undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixth Argument for Mortification of our Members or Luſts, Becauſe our Bodies are Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you, which ye have of God. Our Souls and Bodies were Dedicated to God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in our Baptiſm, and thereby Conſecrated and become Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, through his gracious preſence and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
               <p>But by Luſt, theſe Temples are pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and profaned, and become the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Devils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird, as it is propheſied of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. 2. Conceive we of Mens Luſts flying up and down in their Minds and Imaginations, as Birds do in the Air, or ſhut up in their Hearts, as Birds are cooped up in a Cage, ready to fly out upon opportunity, and break looſe, as the Luſts of Mens hearts are almoſt upon every Occaſion and Temptation.</p>
               <p>You have heard in time of our Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:136902:30"/> Wars, of turning Churches into Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and polluting them; but it is to tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> theſe Temples of the Holy Ghoſt into worſe than Stables, if we proſtitute them to our vile luſts. You read in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29, 30. a Caution, <hi>Let no Corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth;</hi> and it follows in the next verſe, <hi>And Grieve not the holy Spirit;</hi> noting to us, that the pure and holy Spirit of God is grieved, afflicted, and as it were made ſad by naughtineſs of our diſcourſe, thoughts or actions, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to withdraw from us, and to leave us. The moſt naſty Kennels or Gutters, and Sinks, that receive the filth and off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſcouring of things; the very Excrements themſelves, and the worſt dunghils, are not ſuch an Annoyance and Offence unto us, as our vile Luſts and corrupt Affections are to the Holy Spirit of God; theſe are more loathſom, and a greater Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto him, than the moſt ſtinking unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſmells are unto us.</p>
               <p>The laſt Argument ſhall be taken from the tremendous Judgments that the Lord hath Denounced and Inflicted on Sinners in this ſort. <hi>Heb. 13. 4. Whoremongers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, God will Judge;</hi> and that ſeverely too, puniſhing them commonly in this World, and in the World to come. <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:136902:30"/> 6. 2, 3. ſhows you that it had an hand in drowning the World: When the <hi>Sons of God</hi> (that is, the holy Seed of <hi>Seths</hi> Race) <hi>ſaw the Daughters of Men</hi> (wicked Men, and the Children like the Parents wicked too, according to the ſence of the words) <hi>that they were fair, they took them to Wives;</hi> their Luſts within, was ſmitten with the others Beauty, and betrayed them to that graceleſs Match; then it ſoon follows, even in the next verſe, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man;</hi> and after it: <hi>The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man was great in the Earth, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented the Lord that he had made Man: And the Lord ſaid, I will deſtroy Man, whom I have Created, from the Face of the Earth, both Man and Beaſt.</hi> And you know, the filthy Converſation and unlawful Deeds in this kind of the Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as they <hi>vexed Righteous Lot</hi> at the Heart, ſo they brought down the greateſt ſort of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever was inflicted on any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven to conſume <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Plain.

And why ſhould not Men be afraid of ſome ill Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, ſo incident and common to thoſe that make a common trade and practice of this Sin, ſuch a foul and loathſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, that they are an Offence and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to others whither ſoever they come, and can ſcarce be endured above ground; ſo infectious it is, that all ſhun ſuch Creatures. And ah! How many have dyed Martyrs to this Sin! Oh, <hi>England,</hi> that boaſteſt of thoſe that have been Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs for thy God, be aſhamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the number doth ſo much exceed of thoſe that have dyed in this ſort of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom! And O what more lingring deaths have theſe been put to, rotting even alive, and dying by piece-meal, and that with Pain and Torment too, burning with a conſuming Fire, which their Luſts have kindled here, until they come to dwell with that devouring Fire, or fierceneſs of Gods wrath, and everlaſting Burnings hereafter. And ſurely the ſence and conſideration of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:136902:33"/> everlaſting burnings, would have enough in it to quench the flames of Luſt, and make the unclean perſon tremble, and flee from his impure and adulterous embraces, ſo ſhort for pleaſure, but in the pain and puniſhment following them everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Beſides what hath been ſaid, this Sin is no leſs miſchievous to the Souls, than to the Bodies of Men, by corrupting the Judgments of lewd perſons with dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (if not damnable) errours, and their Converſations with filthy and abominable practices, ſcandalous to the pure Religion of Chriſtian: Many Inſtances may be given of this; as in the firſt Century, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> againſt whom, and <hi>Ebion,</hi> denying the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, ſome have thought the Goſpel of St. <hi>John</hi> to have been more directly intended, for Confutation of their Errours. <hi>Cerinthus</hi> pretended to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from Angels (and for ought I know, he might be in the right, if he had Father'd it on the evil Angels, not on the good:) That after the Reſurrection from the dead, Chriſt ſhould have an Earthly Kingdom in this World, and that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Chriſts Kingdom ſhould eat and drink, and Marry, and keep Holy-days; for he himſelf was a Man given to fleſhly Luſts, and he imagined that the pleaſures

               <p>The <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> alſo, mentioned <hi>Rev:</hi> 2. 6. of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, that ſhe hated the Deeds of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>which I alſo hate,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and 5 verſ. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> one of the Deacons choſen by the Apoſtles (as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> writes, <hi>Strom.</hi> 3.) had a Beautiful Wife, and was accuſed of overmuch jealouſie: To purge himſelf, he brought forth his Wife into the midſt of his Brethren, and ſaid, he was content any Man ſhould Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. Of which words, many took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to live promiſcuouſly like Beaſts, no Man having his own proper Wife, but making them all common, as our <hi>Family of Love</hi> did in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days.

                     </gap>ae</hi> or <hi>coenoſi,</hi> becauſe they were filthily polluted in the mire of Uncleanneſs: By their unhoneſt and filthy Converſation it came to paſs, that the true Profeſſors of the Goſpel were vilely Slandered by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting <hi>Pagans,</hi> objecting to Chriſtians the Banquets of <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Oedipus.</hi> The <hi>Encratitae</hi> condemned Marriage in this Century. In the third
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:136902:34"/> Century we read of the <hi>Adamiani,</hi> who had their Aſſemblies in ſubterraneal places, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hypocauſta,</hi> becauſe that under the place of their meetings, a furnace of Fire was kindled to warm the ſame, where they uncloathed themſelves, when they entred into it, and ſtood naked, both Men and Women, according to the Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before their fall. <hi>Apoſtolici</hi> alſo, who among other things, rejected Marriage, giving out a Sentence againſt themſelves, that they were unclean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were procreated by Marriage, and conſequently they were for promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Luſt.</p>

                  <hi>Origeniani</hi> and <hi>Turpes</hi> (as they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) were vile and filthy Beaſts, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring from Whoredom, but from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of Children, to the end, that they might ſeem chaſte, not unlike to <hi>Onan</hi> the Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> whom the Lord deſtroyed. Theſe are mentioned by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Hieracitae,</hi> who condemned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and <hi>Manichees,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius contra Haereſes,</hi> and <hi>Hiſt.

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:136902:34"/> 
                  <hi>Juſtantius, Salvianus,</hi> and <hi>Helpidius,</hi> whom <hi>Adygimus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> Condemned in a Councel; but when Appeals would not relieve them, with Bribes they ſolicited the Emperours Cubiculars, and were ſent back again to enjoy their own places. In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Century, we read of the firſt Councel of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> aſſembled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reigns of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> where we find Canons concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Marriage to ſome perſons, and the admitting of a Man to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who wanteth a Wife, and contenteth himſelf with one Concubine only. In the 6th Century, the Councel of <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ordained that a Biſhop ſhould count his Wife as his Siſter, and that he ſhould no manner of way company with her; and the firſt Councel of <hi>Maetiſcon,</hi> that neither Biſhop nor Presbyter ſhould intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with carnal Luſts: And not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with their Wives, was honeſt and chaſt behaviour, Satan bringing in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and all Uncleanneſs into the Church by this means, until at length Marriage of Prieſts was called the Hereſie of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. In Century the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. in <hi>Alberts</hi> time, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> a ſect of Hereticks which under colour of Religion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:136902:35"/> made all things common, and they moved one another to Carnal Conjunction, alledging it to be a deed of Charity.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider of the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or the prevailing Motives or Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Sin, which are either, Firſt the ſtrong and ſtrange delight and pleaſure of the Sin; our natures by Sin and the fall being as it were ſunk into Fleſh, and brutiſh Senſuality; thoſe things that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the greateſt Gratifications of the Senſe, are the moſt acceptable to our corrupt depraved natures, as this Sin is upon the very ſame account, being a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing ſenſual Sin. What do thoſe that commit this Sin promiſe themſelves but pleaſure? To be ſure, the pleaſure of the Sin is always ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing them, ſo that of all the Temptations to this Sin, this bids the faireſt with the Sinner to gain the point. The Remedy againſt this Temptation:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider, that Man as to the Soul (the more extellent part, that animates and acts the Body in its Life and Motion) is a ſpiritual being, and muſt have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good and happineſs, called <hi>an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>filed,</hi> or pure and uncorrupt, refined from Senſe; when the pleaſures of the fleſh cannot anſwer that noble End for which man is deſigned, nor
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:136902:35"/> ſuit with ſuch a being as Man is, being mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to the Animal, and not the Intellectual Angelical Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though ſome have ſaid, that the pleaſures of Luſt, might vye with the pleaſures of Paradiſe; have you not heard too of a Paradiſe of Fools? For indeed, this is ſuch a Paradiſe, as only Fools and the worſt of Men would take for their Portion and Happineſs: Good and Chaſt, Vertuous and wiſe Men value it but at a a low rate, being convinced of the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and meanneſs of a ſenſible good, the emptineſs and inſufficiency of ſuch good: After long enjoyment, ſuch pleaſures grow flat and dry, perhaps <hi>ad nauſeam uſque,</hi> and Mens appetite to them ceaſeth, as <hi>Amnons</hi> to <hi>Thamar,</hi> or leaveth ſuch a longing and hankering after them, that they are ſtill uneaſie and in pain in the long intervals.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Look and aim at higer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the pleaſures that are to be found in the ways of God; for all his Ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and his paths are peace. You read of thoſe that <hi>call the Sabbath a delight,</hi> and, <hi>delighting thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> taking delight in approaching unto God, and thoſe fearing the Lord, and delighting greatly in his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:136902:36"/>
               <p>Next the pleaſures that follow and flow from a conſcientious diſcharge of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God and Man, ſuch as the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, in whoſe favour is Life, or <hi>vita verè vitalis,</hi> the peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the comforts of the Spirit, and the Hope of Glory, and thoſe better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are at Gods right Hand for evermore, pleaſures in perfection, ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, never cloyed therewith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider though this pleaſure be ſweet in the Mouth, and the taſt, yet it is bitter in the end, and the preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure bought with future pain, this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Eternity. Ah! <hi>Nocet empta do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore voluptas;</hi> ſuch pleaſure coſts too dear, if there be no pain and remorſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when the Sinner reflects on his way and his doings: If the Body eſcape too that Painful and Tormenting Diſeaſe, yet Soul and Body muſt both rue it in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and that not according to the time they enjoyed theſe pleaſures, which would then be ſhort indeed, if their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could end ſo ſoon as their ſhort-lived pleaſure, but <hi>momentum quod delectat,</hi> &amp;c. the act of Sin is tranſient, the guilt, and conſequently the puniſhment <hi>diuturnum,</hi> and beyond that, <hi>aeternum,</hi> not only long, but Eternity long.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:136902:36"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider how unlike this is to the Purity of the <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of finding pleaſure, and being drawn to Sin under that Notion, they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as one of the ſevereſt puniſhments to be proſtituted and expoſed to the Luſts of Men, by Rudeneſs and Violence. This <hi>Tertullian</hi> urgeth in the cloſe of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, <hi>c. ult. p.</hi> 40. While you chooſe to Condemn a Woman that is a Chriſtian to the Stews, then to the Lyons, <hi>ad Lenonem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quam ad Leonem,</hi> you plainly confeſs that the Violation of Chaſtity, is accounted by us an heavier penalty, than any puniſhment or kind of death which you can inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates an eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hereof, <hi>Vita Paul. Eremit. Tom. 1. p. 237. In the</hi> Decian <hi>Perſecution, a young Man, a Chriſtian, in the Flower and Beauty of his Age, was carried into a Garden that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> things conſpiring to make it a place for Pleaſure and Delight, being laid upon a Bed of Down, and faſtned to it with ſilken Cords, the Company withdrawing, a Beautiful Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet was ſent in to him, who careſſing him, and treating him with all the Arts of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not conſiſting with modesty to name, the young Man finding the Temptation beginning to prevail, preſently bit off his Tongue, and ſpit it in her face as ſhe attempted to kiſs him.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:136902:37"/> Origen</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> when put to this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py choice, either to Sacrifice to Idols, or ſuffer his chaſt Body to be defiled with a filthy <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> choſe rather to commit Idolatry, than Fortification, though that too was rather his enemies Act than his own, they thruſting the Frankincenſe into his Hand, and haling him up to the Altar. For which Fact, or the ſcandal of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, he was Excommunicated and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by the Chriſtians: However, this ſhowed his Abhorrence of Uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! Then flee from, and fear the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſmiles, and flattering Luſt, dally not, parly not with them, leaſt the deceitful and tempting pleaſure of this Sin beguile and corrupt thee. Give not place to the Devil, while he is feeding thine imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the pleaſures of the Fleſh, and perſwading thee to taſt of his ſweet Diſh: <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and then he will flee from you. Principiis obſta,</hi> is a good Rule in this caſe, ſtop Sin in its <hi>firſt onſet,</hi> then it is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but gets ground and gathers ſtrength as you give way to it, and entertain it in its motions. The pleaſure of this Sin to a conſidering Man, muſt needs be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, ſuch as commonly all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered even in this Life, brings more grief and diſquietment than Satisfaction: Such
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:136902:37"/> pleaſure as we ſhall be more Spiritual and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without it, than with it; and ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as to be ſure will be bitterneſs in the latter end. Alas! wee look upon Sin only in its <hi>ſpecious poſture</hi> coming towards us, Fair and Beautiful to behold, in a goodly dreſs, recommending it ſelf to us with <hi>Profit, Pleaſure, Honour,</hi> or the like Allurements; but could we ſee the hinder parts of Sin, it would appear like the <hi>Father</hi> of it, the Devil, when he is taking his leave and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, ugly and Deformed: When Sin is going from us after the Commiſſion of it, it is black and Melancholly, hanging down its head with Sorrow, or hiding its Face for Shame or Fear, or like thoſe that gnawed their Tongues for pain, or with gnaſhing of Teeth for very madneſs and Vexation of Spirit, with Scorpion ſtings at the tail of it, to Torment the Sinner, and the Fire burning towards him, to come at him, and catch him within its flames: This ſight indeed, would cool the Sinners Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and make Men flee from Sin as from a Serpent. Again, ſome there are, to whom this Sin holds forth its two fair Breaſts, of <hi>Profit</hi> as well as <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> to allure them within its Embraces: Theſe are chiefly of the <hi>other Sex.</hi> Thoſe who keep publick Houſes, and ſo the keeping of a naughty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:136902:38"/> Woman, brings cuſtom to the Houſe, and they ſay encreaſeth their Trade; and thoſe who are kept as <hi>Miſſes</hi> to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and I ſuppoſe look upon themſelves to have attained great Preferment, beſides thoſe that proſtitute themſelves to the Luſts of any comers in a common promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous manner, perhaps making a Trade of this Sin, and getting their Maintenance this way. Other ſome perhaps by promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Luſts to hinder <hi>Conception,</hi> and ſo for prevention of more Children, and to ſave the charge and coſt that is required in the feeding and cloathing and <hi>portioning</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, how vile a thing is it to let out themſelves to hire, to fell as it were their Souls for the poſſeſſion of the Devil that <hi>unclean</hi> Spirit, and their Bodies to the filthy Luſts of Men. O ſhame upon thoſe that renounced the <hi>World</hi> (Worldly gain ſo far as Sinful) the <hi>Fleſh and the Devil,</hi> thus ſhamefully to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize! How near doth their Sin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> who <hi>ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to work wickedneſs,</hi> and hath it ſet as a Brand or Mark of Infamy upon him, and whoſe Sin was ſo notoriouſly great, that it could not be cleanſed without the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Family.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:136902:38"/>
               <p>Secondly, Others there are that find this a very <hi>Chargeable Sin,</hi> putting them to the charge firſt of a Treat or Entettain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for the <hi>Act of Naughtineſs,</hi> and a third charge many times for the <hi>Cure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</hi> The keeping of lewd Women, and providing portions for their baſe Brood, <hi>Adulterous iſſue,</hi> hath waſted great Eſtates, and been the ruine of many Families, or at leaſt what vaſt expences hath it put many to, ſo that what the one party gets, the other loſeth, and more beſides. Even ſome among the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sex have been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in this World, ſometimes by Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as were too well known by them before, in the days of their <hi>firſt Husband,</hi> and who hath ſpent all, and brought them to Poverty; or if of meaner Rank, by getting ſuch a noiſome Diſtemper, as hath made them abhorred by all, that none would imploy them for a <hi>livelyhood,</hi> none Receive or Entertain them; or which made them unfit for work, or ſo weakned and impaired their ſtrength, that they could do but little when their old Age came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or their Trade failed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All ſuch Gain as is gotten in this manner, is accurſed, it will defile the reſt of your Subſtance, even contrary to what is ſaid of Alms; <hi>Give Alms of ſuch
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:136902:39"/> things as ye have,</hi> and <hi>behold all things are clean unto you;</hi> that is, cleanſed from Sin, Sanctifyed, Bleſſed, ſo as not only to have them with Gods leave, but with his Love. But ſuch filthy lucre (in the literal down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Senſe of the words) will make all polluted and unclean, all under the curſe, if ſuch gain at the laſt will not be ſeparated from the reſt, even the clean from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. When did you ever know any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a Family by this means, with an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Wealth? Is it not likely that ſome at leaſt of the Poſterity, ſhould ſpend and conſume it upon their Luſts, in the ſame way that the other got it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you get never ſo much Gain this way, yet when you come to caſt up your accounts at the General Reckoning and great Day of Accounts, you will come off a loſer, an eternal loſer, when all your gain will ſignifie nothing, none of it abide with you for your comfort. But what would it profit you, if you gained never ſo much in this World? For what ſhall one give in exchange for the Soul? That is, the Soul is of ſo much worth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World can equalize it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can vye with, or countervail the loſs of an immortal Soul, which is an infinite loſs, being loſt to all Eternity, and ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:136902:39"/>
               <p>Fifthly; As to thoſe Married perſons, who proſtitute their Bodies to the Luſts of Men, leaſt they ſhould conceive and bear Children, and bring a charge upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by living honeſtly with their own Husbands:</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, That doth not always take effect. All that do or would keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in this manner, cannot have their end in this. For all are not ſo bad and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably wicked, as to ruſh headlong into ſuch a damning guilt as Adultery is: Nay, I hope, very few in our Country Pariſhes remote from the City, but what would ſtartle and boggle at ſuch a wickedneſs, and what through their neceſſary Employments in their Worldly buſineſs, and the fear of being diſcovered, or ſtrongly ſuſpected, if they ſhould Treſpaſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e often in ſuch perſons Company; and what through their Ignorance of theſe Women, that are ſo evil and Adulterous, few even of theſe that would make no Conſcience of the Sin, do actually concur for the prevention of Children in theſe promiſcuous Luſts.</p>
               <p>Again, Parents ought to truſt God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Children, that God (as the Prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b is) who ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:136902:40"/> Children to periſh for want of Food. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 9. When was it known? Scarce ever, that any Infant or Child ſhould be ſtarved. You know the Law will allow them neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Again, Thirdly, Thoſe that have many Children, above all perſons are the fitteſt Objects of Charity: For it is ſome ſign that they live honeſtly and chaſtly; and the charge which they are to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to a Pariſh, is ſuch as God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offer to them, and ſuch as cannot be avoided well, nor juſtly blamed.

               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe who are addicted to this Vice, in their variety are like to meet with thoſe of both ſorts, <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> and to get a ſpice of an ill Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that will diſcover the Wife to her Husband, or Husband to the Wife, and ſometimes to all the Neighbours, and they become contemptible upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to all that know them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though Married Women have got (as the Proverb ſaith,) <hi>a Cloak for their ſin,</hi> yet you know the Fruits of this Sin diſcover themſelves in thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are corrupted before Marriage, and their ſhame comes to light.

               <p>Fifthly, The Providence of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the diſcovery of this wickedneſs very often remarkably: He ſo diſquiets the Conſcience of ſome of the perſons, that they can have no peace untill they diſcover it: if ever they come to any ſenſe of, and Repentance for the Sin, they muſt confeſs their offence and ask forgiveneſs, eſpecially if it can be done prudentially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without an open publiſhing of their ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Or how often doth the Child prove the very Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Lover, and diſcover it, ſo that people read Adultery in the Face of it, and can diſcern the true Father of it! Or when people come to dye, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> leaſt, the Conſcience finds the weight of Adultery lye heavy upon it; and thoſe that are under ſuſpition of it, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, according to our duty, may put it to them, that if they find their Conſciences troubled with any weighty matter, (as it is in the <hi>Viſitation of the Sick,</hi>) to make ſpecial confeſſion of their Sin, and not to go out of the World, with ſuch a guilt upon their Souls unrepented of.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If they ſhould hide it from Man at the time of acting this Sin, yet ſhall not <hi>God</hi> ſee it. I have read of a Woman, who being very importunate with one of the Fathers, (<hi>Paphnutius,</hi>) to corrupt him, he at laſt yielded to her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe could contrive it ſo, as to be ſure none ſhould ſee them; and when ſhe had led him up into the moſt ſecret Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe thought ſhe had done the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are you ſure that there is no one preſent?</hi> or to that effect; <hi>doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:136902:48"/> Gods ſight and preſence urged home by him, ſhe was ſo effectually convinced, that ſhe fetched a deep Groan, her eyes run down with tears, ſhe fell down upon her Knees, deteſting her wicked Life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ntinued for her life-time praying, <hi>Thou that madeſt me, have mercy upon me.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, thou that art afraid to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery in the Market-place, or in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thy Husband, how art thou not afraid to ſin in the preſence of that God, who is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity?</hi> If men ſee thee, thou wouldeſt be aſhamed, but God ſees thee, and his Eye is upon thee, who beholdeth ungodlineſs, and wrong to requite it, and recompenſe the ſinner according to his ways: He ſeeth in ſecret, into the ſecrets of thy heart, and intentions of Adultery, and into thy <hi>ſecret Chambers. Pſal.</hi> 139. ſets forth Gods all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye, and Omnipreſence. And you know God hath appointed a <hi>day in which he will Judge the World;</hi> and as <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 14. God ſhall bring every work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing.</hi> Matth. 4. 22. <hi>There is nothing hid which ſhall not be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, neither any thing</hi> kept <hi>ſecret</hi> but that it ſhall <hi>come abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, laſtly, Some are emboldned to ſin with the hopes of <hi>Repentance;</hi> they ſay
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:136902:48"/> it is but repenting and all is well; and though now their youthful blood runs hot in their Veins, yet when the heat of youth is over, or when they are out of their Time, ſaith this or that Apprentice, and when they light of a good Match, they will Marry and live honeſtly.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, I could heartily wiſh that you would repent at any time, but I muſt tell you, you are not ſure of repenting at all unleſs you do it now. There are thouſands in Hell who meant to repent before they dyed, but they preſumed that they were yet young enough, and might have time to repent hereafter, and ſo ſinned on untill they were either hardened in their ſin, and had no will to repent; or put it off ſo long until Death came upon them in their unpardoned and unrepented ſins, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſins they periſhed everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And tell me, would it not be ſad to put off Repentance ſo long?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thy reſolving to Repent ſo many years hence, is but a <hi>purpoſing to ſin</hi> in the mean while; and that muſt be a ſin of knowledge, againſt checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, telling thee that thou oughteſt to repent at preſent; and ſinning deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately too, conſidering thy danger and the hazard thou runneſt in not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:136902:49"/> at preſent; and a ſinning wilfully too, thou wilt have thy ſin at preſent whatever comes of it: and all theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a great meaſure of guilt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſin leaves little place for <hi>Repentance:</hi> Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts of Whoredom and Adultery do not uſe to go ſingly, but to multiply in their kind. When hath it been known that ſuch Perſons have ſtopt at the firſt act, and ſinned no more, eſpecially if they have opportunity for more? And you know that this ſin it ſelf is <hi>great and deadly,</hi> (as St. <hi>James,</hi> 3. 8. uſeth that word, and our Church, <hi>From Fornication and all other dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, good Lord deliver us.</hi>) If one ſingle act of Fornication be ſuch an hainous ſin, much more will repeated acts of the ſame ſin harden men in ſin paſt all recovery. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the pleaſure of this Sin is of ſuch a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, their Affections diſcover themſelves, and they would fain have opportunity to ſin again: Nay, this Sin begets ſuch a love in the Adulterous Perſons, that an Husband or a Wife muſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:136902:49"/> be left, if not (as ſometimes it falls out) murthered, that they may be the more free and undiſturbed in the enjoyment of each other. Upon which accounts, and becauſe this Sin exceedingly griev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the Pure and Holy Spirit of God, that proves true by common experience, which we find in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 18, 19. of the <hi>ſtrange Woman, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the Guide of her youth, and forgetteth the Covenant of her God,—for her houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead,</hi> yea, and to the <hi>damned: None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life:</hi> Scarce any that go to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or repent unto Life and Salvation, as thoſe words import. Think of this place of Scripture when you are tempted by a lewd Woman; think of it ſeriouſly, and repeat it inwardly in your minds, and if there be opportunity ſpeak it openly in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, by ſinning to Fornication or Adultery, the Soul is fair for ruine; yet (with <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> whoſe error mentioned in Mr. <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Hiſtory of the Church,</hi>) <q>Poſſibly God may grant to them that have ſinned <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but if we ſin oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than once or twice, there is no more <hi>renewing by Repentance,</hi> or pardon for ſin, but a <hi>fearful expectation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </q> Though Gods Mercy, which is Infinite, and can abundantly pardon, muſt not be limited as if he could not, nor would not pardon thoſe that have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and multiplyed their acts of ſin, if they repent; and becauſe Gods Grace is freely

The Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> p. 7, 8. That the Chriſtians knew one another by certain privy marks and ſigns, and were wont to be in love with, almoſt before they knew one another; that they exerciſed Luſt and Filthineſs under a pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, promiſcuouſly calling themſelves Brothers and Siſters, that by the help of ſo ſacred a Name, their common Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries might become inceſtuous; that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſolemn day they met together at a Feaſt with their Wives, Children, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Mothers; where after they begin to be warm and merry wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exceſs of Wine, Fleſh is thrown for the Dogs, who being tied to the Candleſticks, begin to leap and frisk about until they have run away with and put out the lights, and then in the dark, the fit cover for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Villany, they promiſcuouſly run amongſt one another into filthy and inceſtuous Embraces. One would ſcarce think it could enter into the Heart of Man to conceive ſuch abominable falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

               <p>Another Means for the Mortification of our Luſts, or at leaſt a good Preventive and Preſervative from Sins of this ſort, is to abſtain from <hi>leud Company;</hi> as <hi>Pſal. 18. 26. With the Pure thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelf pure.</hi> There is a Proverb among the <hi>Jews, Tell me with whom thou goest, and I will tell thee what thou doſt:</hi> And ſo in <hi>Prov. 22. 24, 25. Make no friendſhip with an angry Man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go, leaſt thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare to thy Soul:</hi> The like may be ſaid of every Sinner. And indeed we are not only apt to learn the ways of the wicked, but we <hi>grieve the Holy Spirit</hi> of God, by chooſing his known Enemies for our Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates; by an intimate Fellowſhip with ſuch we loſe the Fellowſhip of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in time ſhall find our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with their evil courſes, whoſe Company we ſo much delight in. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a lewd Man hath corrupted his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, drawing him along with him to the impure and unchaſt embraces of an Harlot, and involved him in the ſame guilt and condemnation with himſelf. By the Company and Allurements of ill Women, how many hopefull young Men have been enſnared and captivated, and ruined Soul and Body for ever! This hath been the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:136902:78"/> undoing of thouſands, and hath made them a grief to their Father, and a ſhame to her that bore them! Chriſtians are out of Gods way, and conſequently out of Gods Protection while they are in ſuch bad Company, fall they may, and that foully too. And many a Young Maiden, or Young Woman, more innocently minded, by the temptations and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſolicitations of lewd Perſons, whoſe Company they delighted in, have been robbed of Modeſty and Chaſtity at once: And when once they have tranſgreſs'd, they have thought there was no other way of ſaving their Credit, but by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying their Whoredoms in a promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous <hi>Concubitus,</hi> whereby they think to hide their ſhame from the World, as if they had not ſinned; after the way of an Adulterous Woman, that <hi>wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I have done none ill.</hi> And thus it comes to paſs, that thoſe who at firſt had ſome modeſty in ſinning, and ſenſe of ſhame in ſo doing, and were fain, as it were, to offer Violence to their baſhfulneſs; yet in time come to grow bold in ſin, and from being tempted fall to tempting and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting others, and make a trade of ſin, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their ſouls into deſparation or an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hardneſs and impenitency of Heart.</p>

               <p>The <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> Century, furniſheth us with inſtances how much the Monaſtick and Nunniſh life grew into requeſt. <hi>Pelagii Laodicenus</hi> married a young Woman, and the firſt Night after her Marriage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her to prefer Virginal Chaſtity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marryed life. <hi>Aeas</hi> alſo, who marryed a young Wife, procreated three Children with her, and in the end left her, and entered into a Monaſtery, forgetting his Matrimonial Covenant.

For as for ſecond Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they are but a more plauſible and decorous kind of Adultery. Minutius Foelix,</hi> We wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly contain our ſelves within the Bond of ſingle Marriage, and either know but one Woman, or none. The Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as <hi>Zonaras</hi> tells us, in <hi>Can. 7. Concil. Neocaeſ.</hi> ſuſpended ſuch perſons from the Communion for a whole year: And the Council of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 1. though it determine not the time, yet it requires that they ſhould ſpend ſome ſmall time at leaſt in Penance, in Faſting and Prayer, before they be received to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And by the Canons called Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:136902:88"/> 
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 17. ſuch an one was rendered by his ſecond Marriage, incapable of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the Miniſtry; which ſeem to be much more genuine proper Senſe of the Canons, than of Marriage to another Wife upon Divorce of the former, which had Allowance in ſome places from the Laws of the People: <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> was more moderate in the Caſe, <hi>Stromat. Lib. 3. p. 428. We admire the Gravity and Stayedneſs of thoſe who content themſelves with a ſingle Marriage; but yet ſay withal, that Compaſſion ought to be had of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that of the Apoſtle, is to take place in ſecond Marriages; If they</hi> cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>they ſhould</hi> Marry: <hi>For it is better to Marry than to burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Condemning of firſt or ſecond Marriage, hath been of Ill-Conſequence to the Church of God. <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt called <hi>Magnus,</hi> made a Conſtitution, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the Marriage of Prieſts, but in his time was forced to Abrogate it, becauſe it was not only the occaſion of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo of ſecret Murthers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Babes: Inſomuch, that I have read, that upon emptying of a pond near the Religious Houſes, there were found abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Infants Bones in it. Whereas the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>it was better to Marry than
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:136902:89"/> to burn,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was forced to ſay, It was better to Marry than to Murther. Another Evil beſides, was the taking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines inſtead of Wives, and ſo Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom inſtead of Marriage, as the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Toledo;</hi> where they made firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons for the Prohibition of Marriage to ſome perſons, and then reckon'd it a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to content themſelves with one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, or at leaſt tolerate in admitting ſuch perſons to the Communion. Inſtead of Marriage, alſo Adultery, as Pope <hi>John</hi> the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> who was killed in the very Act of Adultery by the Husband of the Woman whom he defiled. And it is a common ſaying of the Romiſh Prieſts, <hi>That their Children warm themſelves by other Folks Fires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vows of perpetual Chaſtity or Continence, have occaſioned other harm than that of Secret Whoredoms and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: even <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretick had vowed Chaſtity, but afterward polluted himſelf with Whoredom, and was caſt out of the Church, and coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and being denyed the fellowſhip of the Church, he fell to <hi>Cerdon,</hi> and Augmented his Errour of a Supream <hi>Inviſible God:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a <hi>Viſible God,</hi> Creator of all things: Thirdly, the <hi>Devil</hi> as a <hi>mid-thing</hi> between
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:136902:89"/> the Viſible and Inviſible God. This Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſpread it ſelf in <hi>Italy, Egypt, Paleſtina, Arabia, Syria, Cyprus, Thebaida, Perſia,</hi> and many other places. They denyed alſo the Reſurrection. <hi>Marcion</hi> called juſtly by <hi>Tertullian, Primogenitus Diaboli,</hi> the firſt-born of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Now by way of Tryal and <hi>Examination,</hi> whether you have attained to this <hi>Purity of Heart,</hi> and Mortification of Luſt. Firſt, Mortification muſt be laid at <hi>the Root of the Tree,</hi> a deadly Wound be given Sin at the Heart. It is not enough to Lop off ſome of the Branches, to cut off ſome of the outward Acts of Sin, for theſe will grow again in time. To cleanſe the Streams will be to little purpoſe, if the Fountain be left unſcowred, that will ſend forth ſuch foul waters again, as ſhall make all Mire and Dirt. Thus the Heart muſt be purged and cleanſed from filthineſs, elſe the Life will be polluted and unclean. The labour at the Pump of the Ship in caſting the Waters out, will ſignifie little, while they neglect to ſtop the Leak: The Heart lets in all theſe Evils which defile the Man: Therefore the Heart muſt be rectifyed, and the abundance of wickedneſs ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſuppreſſed there.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Rule</hi> to know when the Heart is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:136902:90"/> purged and purified, is, when the <hi>Will is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved</hi> for Purity againſt all the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, and that with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and deliberate, fixed and ſettled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution. Suddain Purpoſes, as they are taken up without conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the difficulties they ſhall meet with, ſo they fail in time of Trial and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but when all the hinderances are weighed, and all the allurements of the Fleſh, and a Man finds himſelf armed with a Chriſtian Courage, and <hi>ſtrong in the Lord and the power of his might,</hi> what hardſhip and difficulty ſoever there be in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his Luſts; (for the words <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> and <hi>crucifying the Fleſh with Affections and Luſts,</hi> import that there is a great deal of pain and miſery in the Duty, much of Self-denial in this Purification of the Heart) then ſuch a Purpoſe, ſuch a Reſolution as this, is like to carry it; for <hi>Voluntas do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina membrorum,</hi> the Will commands the outward Man; and if the Will be fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fully bent againſt Whoredoms, Adulteries, and alſo other acts of Luſt, againſt corrupt Communication, lewd Company, laſcivious Songs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the man is like to be and act accordingly: for Men do not uſe to be forced to theſe groſſer ſins againſt their Wills, though I deny not but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:136902:90"/> that corruption is working in the Saints, and ſtirring them up through the inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan to the doing the evil which they would not do, and hindering them from doing the good which they ſhould and would do, in the Combate between the Fleſh and the Spirit, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14.

In actual ſins commonly at leaſt and ordinarily, God doth not uſe to charge any more of ſin upon us than there was of the Will in the deed, even ſo much evil was there in it; yet here we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between ſuch ſins as were voluntary at firſt, and afterwards Perſons may be given up unto them and ſin involuntarily, and be but a ſpiritual Curſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lord upon them; or when there is ſome other ſin which is voluntary and allowed of, ſinning that ſin knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wilfully, Perſons may juſtly be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſome other ſin involuntarily and yet culpably.</p>

               <p>Next, when there is a real <hi>Hatred and Enmity</hi> between us and our Luſts. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When there is an <hi>effectual reſiſtance</hi> of the Temptations to this ſin, ſuch a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as prevails againſt the Temptations from without, and our own Luſts, and overcometh and eſcapeth the pollutions which are in the World through Luſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a Chriſtian <hi>holds out Praying</hi> againſt his Luſts, and that with a real and unfeigned deſire to be preſerved from the evil of them, and uſeth all holy means and Ordinances of God in Faith, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon God for this preſerving Grace. There is never a Prayer, hearty Prayer, but it gives a wound to the Fleſh and our Luſts, a mortifying blow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When there is <hi>a Zeal</hi> againſt this ſin in one kind as well as in another, and that not out of an hypocritical pretence to ſeem holy and more pure than others, but out of a ſenſe of the evil, and a concern for the Honour of God and our Religion. There is much of Anger and Indignation in Zeal, and that argues ſomewhat to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and diſpleaſe, which we may apply to the Luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Men; we really hate and diſlike this ſin when we are truly Zealous againſt it. We are commanded in the firſt of <hi>Tim. 5. 22. Partake not of other mens
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:136902:91"/> ſins: keep thy ſelf pure.</hi> Every filthy ſpeech, lewd Story, or unlawful Deed, and Act of Luſt of others, which pleaſeth you and delighteth you; ſo that you diſlike it not, and ſhew not your diſlike of it by leaving the Company, or ſhaking your head, or reproving and admoniſhing the Offenders, brings a guilt upon you: So that if you would be pure, you muſt not partake of other mens ſins.</p>
               <p>The Third Rule for Trial of this Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the <hi>ſpiritual ſight and ſenſe</hi> of this Sin. A Man that hath been uſed to live in a bad, foggy, unwholſome Air, he diſcerneth not, feeleth not any thing noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom or offenſive in it; it is all one to him as it were pure Air. Thus is it with one that hath an Heart habitually filthy and unclean, evil luſtings are not evil to him or in his Account, they do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him or offend him, he ſeeth no ſuch hurt in them, but that if he forbear the groſſer acts he may be a pure Saint; and ſo they ſettle themſelves, and lodge in the Heart quietly and without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But a Chriſtian, that hath an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Purity in his heart, if at any time his Luſts do ſtir and are tempting, and continue for a time (and it is but for a time only) thus ſoliciting him, they are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:136902:92"/> as a Diſeaſe, grievous to one that uſeth to enjoy his Health; he is in pain and miſery as one that hath a bone out of joynt; they are as a wound to his Spirit, as an heavy burthen; the Man is reſtleſs and uneaſie, and cannot be ſatisfied until he get rid of theſe unclean Spirits, and recover his former purity again.</p>
               <p>As for our own ſins, ſo for the <hi>ſins of the Nation,</hi> to bewail them and lay them to heart, as it is a great help to the Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Luſt, ſo is it an infallible ſign (being conjoyned with the former) that our heart is purified, and the love to this ſin mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the <hi>2d</hi> Ep. to <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. ch. 7. and 8. Verſes, you will find <hi>Righoeous Lot vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked;</hi> and again its ſaid, <hi>in ſeeing and hearing, that he vexed his righteous Soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds:</hi> And ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. and 2. <hi>Oh that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging place, that I might leave my People, and go from them, for they be all Adulterers.</hi> Jer. 23. 9, 10. <hi>Mine heart within me is broken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Land is full of Adulterers.</hi> Pſal. 119. 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy Law:</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> wept for his own ſin in this kind, his Adultery; ſo no doubt but it fetched tears from him, to bewail the ſins of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:136902:92"/> others againſt the ſeventh Commandment as well as the reſt: 158. v. <hi>I beheld the Tranſgreſſors and was grieved, becauſe they kept not thy Word.</hi> Where the Godly have offended moſt, when they are recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they uſe to repent moſt, and to grieve moſt for ſins of that kind, to manifeſt the truth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and grieving alſo for the fearful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that this Sin muſt needs bring down upon this Nation. Oh but to what a paſs is this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come! That inſtead of grieving at the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous guilt, and trembling at the fearful Judgments that theſe Abominations have denounced againſt them in the Word of God, are ſo far hardened as to make it matter of Sport and Paſtime, their laughter and merriment with the Adultery, and the lewd Women of Great Perſons. How many abuſive Jeſts are there upon the blameleſs Husband of the Adultereſs, to ſhame him! It would not be ſerious enough to mention them, nor the Name which is commonly given him. He that would not partake of the Judgments of God, and the Plagues Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal, when he comes to take Vengeance on the Nation for this Sin, and other our Sins, which without a further Reformation, are not like to go unpuniſhed, muſt be in the number of thoſe that mourn in <hi>Zion,</hi> for <hi>all theſe abominations.</hi> Oh how provoking a thing is it to <hi>make a mock of Sin!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one great ſtep towards committing of the Sin, to have pleaſure in it when acted by others. And no wonder if this Sin break forth in their Hearts and their Lives, who are ſuch friends to it in the Diſcourſe, and who are ſo much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with it in the <hi>Story,</hi> will be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>acting</hi> of it, and ſhow plainly enough that they have not mortified their Uncleanneſs of Heart, not the ſweet, not the pleaſure of the Sin. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:136902:93"/> the inhumanity of this practice that makes it Diverſion, Recreation, to toſs about the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from one to the other, until they go round the Pariſh, and afford jocular Entertainment to all that hear and know the Offenders. If a Man fell into a Pit, and lamed, or wounded, or grievouſly hurt himſelf, ſo as by that fall to bring his life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great and apparent Danger, were not that Man to be pitied, rather than laughed or ſcoffed at? and thus it is with the Adulterous Perſons, they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pit and ſnare of the Devils, and of the Fleſh; they wound their ſouls moſt ſorely and deſperately, and bring themſelves into ſuch danger of eternal Death and Damnation, as that but very few eſcape; and are not ſuch Perſons Objects of pity? And ſhould we not be compaſſionately concerned for them, if we have any ſenſe of that ſad and wretched caſe they are in? Not as many, laugh at their Calamity, and mock at their Miſery, which is moſt barbarous. You that can weep at the Death of a Friend, and are afflicted in any great Affliction that befalls them, what, can't you ſhed a tear for their Eternal Condition, and the Evil which this Sin expoſeth them unto?</p>
               <p>The laſt Mark for Diſcovery of this Purity, is from the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of it. Sin may be held in for a while by common Reſtraining Grace; and ſo the outward Acts be forborn, until the Violence of Temptation comes to try and aſſault their Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then it cannot hold it out without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle of Grace, and an Heart ſet againſt the Sin with Reſolution. If your Purity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity hold in the heat of Summer, as well as in the cold of Winter; when temptation is preſent, and you have opportunities of ſin, as well as when there are none of theſe nigh you to importune you: If the manner and courſe of your Life be chaſt, if it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:136902:93"/> be common, cuſtomary, without any relapſes into your old ſins and Acts of Whoredom, or the like, for one ſuch Act calls all your Repentance into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and may ſet you again into your old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and unmortifie all your Morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>on. Where ſhall we find the Purity and Chaſtity of a Chriſtian? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that boaſts her ſelf to be the Mother of all Churches, or the Metropolis of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſhe is become the <hi>Mother of Harlots</hi> in a literal ſence; as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. And as to their Doctrine, corrupted too, <hi>forbidding to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and allowing <hi>Fornication</hi> before it: And that they may not want proviſion for their Luſt, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Popes have not only given an open To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of <hi>Brothel-houſes,</hi> but received Salaries from them. And though the late Puritan Pope, as they called him, excell'd his Anceſtors, and would not ſuffer them in his Territories, yet they removed but a little further, and ſet up their Brothel-houſes in the very next Principality.</p>
               <p>As to our own Nation, that goeth under the Name of Reformed, but hath as much and more need of a Reformation now in this particular, than ever in the Times of Popery: We read of one or two of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Kings that kept their Women, or rather ſome particular Perſon for this ill uſe, but it was in corners and by ſtealth: but hath not our late King of the Reformation out-done all that were before him in the number and multitude of his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their open-fac'd Boldneſs and Impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. So that it hath had too great an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Examples of Great Perſons, and grown into Faſhion at Court, <hi>Regis ad exemplum.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? And if Innocency be any where to be found, it is in the remote corners of the land: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo far off or near as places are to her, ſo much the more or leſs corrupt are they in this particular.</p>
               <p>And as to the Sacred Order, it is to be feared (and never enough to be bewailed) that they alſo are infected with this Vice, and the very Fountains and Nurſeries of Learning corrupted; that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Opportunities of ſinning abound even among them, which together with their youthful Luſts are powerful, and almoſt irreſiſtible inducements to ſin. To conclude, all Orders and Degrees, high and low, rich and poor, Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, and People, have declared their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and have great need to declare and manifeſt their Repentance as clear and as publick as their Sin.</p>
               <p>Next come we to an <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>Exhortation:</hi> Be we entreated and perſwaded then to <hi>mortifie and reform</hi> our corruptions in this kind; for ſurely by what hath been ſaid, you muſt needs be convinced that there is great need of a Reformation herein. And to begin firſt with the Magiſtracy, we cannot but own it a wonderful Bleſſing from Heaven, that we have ſuch a Prince, over whom (as it hath been the common Obſervation) Wine and Women have no Power: Both King and Queen unſpotted in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:136902:94"/> and moſt exemplary. And ſince great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and multitudes have followed the Vices of Princes, why ſhould they not be followed in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but walk as it were in a path by themſelves, ſingle and alone.</p>
               <p>Beſides, It were to be wiſhed, that ſuch Laws were made as might ſeverely puniſh <hi>Adultery,</hi> and other Perſons that are infamous for their lewdneſs, or that life were put into ſuch Laws as are already made, and that the Magiſtrate would ſee to the due Execution of them; and be very active and zealous to ſuppreſs all ſuch Publick Houſes as are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon this Account, or to reform them, if it can be done without it, elſe to put them down. Alas! Whoredom and Adultery are bare-faced, as it were in contempt or defiance of the Laws both of God and Man; and Perſons that have been found faulty, and that are pointed at as they go along in the Streets, walking to pick up ſome of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades and Aſſociates; ſuch as theſe brazen-ſac'd it out, and there is none, or ſcarce any to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them, or a terrour to ſuch evil-doers.</p>
               <p>And as to the Miniſtry, it is very neceſſary that ſuch ſhould fall under the Laſh of Diſcipline, and ſuch as are known to live in Whoredom or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, how great ſoever they be, (Kings and Princes not excepted) that they be barred the Holy Communion, according to the Cannons of our Church, which ſtrictly forbid it: And 1 Ep. <hi>Cor. 5. 11. I have written unto you not to keep Company, if any man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with ſuch an one, no not to eat:</hi> and in 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 14. For what Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what Communion hath Llght with Darkneſs?</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi>

                  <hi>Canon</hi> 109. of our Church: <hi>If any offend their Brethren either by Adultery, Whoredom, Inceſt, or Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, or by Swearing, Ribaldry</hi> (a kind of Baudy Speech) <hi>or any other Uncleanneſs or Wickedneſs of Life, the Church-Wardens ſhall faihtfully preſent all and every of the ſaid Offenders, to the intent, that they and every of them may be puniſhed by the Severity of the Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Deſerts: And ſuch Notorious Offenders ſhall not be admitted to the Holy Communion, until they be Reformed.</hi> Amongſt all the Sins that were puniſhed in the Ancient Church, <hi>Adultery</hi> was one of the chief; whoever was Convicted of it, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately caſt out of the Church, and diſowned as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Member. In thoſe firſt times, the puniſhment of Adultery was very great, perpetual Penance all a Mans Life, and ſcarce being admitted into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the very hour of Death; till Pope <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrinus</hi> about the year 216. conſidering the great Inconveniences of ſo much Severity, Perſons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being oft driven into Deſpair, and others diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from coming over to the Chriſtian Faith, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Penance in this caſe ſhould be limited to a ſhorter time, which being ended, ſuch perſons might be received again into the Boſom of the Church. This Decree was oppoſed by the <hi>African</hi> Churches, as an Innovation. By the <hi>Ancyran</hi> Councel, <hi>Anno</hi> 315. it was Decreed, that whoever was Guilty of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould be puniſh'd with ſeven years Penance for the firſt fault; and if he fell afterwards into the ſame Sin again, he was not to be taken into Communion, no not at the hour of Death, <hi>Can. 7. p.</hi> 13.

Fornication at 7 years Penance. The Cenſures of the Church did much vary according to time and place in this particular, yet the mildeſt of them ſhewed how deteſtable all filthineſs and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whatſoever, was to thoſe firſt Ages of the Church, and how much the looſneſs of the latter Ages, hath receded <hi>from the Primitive</hi> ſtrictneſs in Diſcipline. Indeed in <hi>Geneva,</hi> there is yet ſome Severity ſhewed, puniſhing Fornication the firſt time with ſome days (9 days to the beſt of my Remembrance) Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, the ſecond time with one years Baniſhment, the third time if they Relapſe with Death. It is well known (as Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays,) that the Civil Laws in the Primitive Church, puniſhed Adultery with Death, the Husband killing the Wife in the Act with Allowance from the Law. I need not mention that Heathen Prince, as puniſhed Adultery with the putting out both the eyes of the Offenders, and his Son being caught in the Crime, he put out one of his own eyes, and one of his Sons eyes, to ſatisfie the Law. To mention but one inſtance more of this kind, becauſe of Civil, and not Eccleſiaſtical Relation. The Emperour <hi>Aurelian</hi> having found one of his Souldiers to have committed Adultery with his Hoſteſs, in his Exerciſe of <hi>Military Diſcipline</hi> he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:136902:96"/> commanded, that having bowed down the Heads of two Trees growing nigh together, the Souldiers legs ſhould be tyed thereto, which being ſuddenly let go, he was torn in two parts, the one hanging by the one Tree, the other by the other. Some of the Brutiſh Creatures may teach us Diſcipline, and Storks (a ſort of chaſt Birds) which are accuſtomed to beat thoſe Storks out of their Number, that having a Mate, joyn themſelves unto another: And ſhall not we Chriſtians ſeparate them from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who defile other Mens Wives? And ſome keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company with them openly, and leaving their own Wives and Husbands for the Adulterous Lover: Others keeping their Whores under their Wives Noſe. Is there no remedy from the Civil nor Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Cenſures againſt this lewdneſs? Or is there a lukewarmneſs and indifferency among the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, as unconcerned, and not offended at their vile practices? Is there no Scandal in theſe things? Are they not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is there any <hi>Quaker, Anabaptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> who doth not make the Lewdneſs and Debauchery of ſome Conformiſts, the chief reaſon and ground of his Separation? Why are our Cenſurers (ſaith Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Tailor,</hi> Epiſtle before <hi>Lib. of Proph.</hi> in <hi>Collect.</hi> of <hi>Diſc.

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:136902:96"/> and therefore the former are fit Objects for a pious Zeal to conteſt againſt.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed alſo, that Parents and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Governours would do their parts, and ſuffer it not in their Children or Servants to do ſo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Though they cannot purifie and ſanctifie, or work Grace in the hearts of thoſe committed to their care, yet they may check the firſt Motions to ſuch evil courſes, and by their Authority rebuke them ſharply, and reſtrain them from ſuch lewd Places and Perſons, Books, Ballads, Plays, Songs, and the like, as have any natural tendency to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, and thoſe that are hardned in ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and incorrigible, they may ſend them going if Servants, and get better in their rooms; and if Children, not to ſatisfie themſelves in ſuch a faint Reproof as <hi>Eli</hi> gave his Sons, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 22, 23, 24. Eli being very old, heard what his Sons did unto all Iſrael, and how they lay with the women that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and he ſaid unto them, Why do ye ſuch things? for I hear of your evil doings by all this People: Nay, my Sons, for it is no good report that I hear, ye make the Lords People to tranſgreſs:</hi> In the Third <hi>Chap.</hi> and the 13 verſ. <hi>I have told him,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that I will judge his</hi> (that is <hi>Eli</hi>'s) <hi>houſe, for the Iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi> Therefore the Lord expects that Parents ſhould uſe their Authority, and reſtrain their Children from filthy Speeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when young by Correction, afterwards by Rebuke, and a Senſe of their Diſpleaſure at their evil ways, and all other good Means which can be uſed: And that every good Chriſtian ſhould ſhew his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this wickedneſs, frequently and powerfully reproving it, to diſcountenance the ſin, that it may be aſhamed and confounded, and carry it no longer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:136902:97"/> in Vogue and Al-a-mode. And to this end, O that all manner of Chriſtians would bewail the preſent guilt of the Nation, in a ſelf-abaſing, ſelf-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humiliation, as the Lord calls for in <hi>Jer. 3. 13. Onely acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed against the Lord thy God, and hast ſcatiered thy ways to the Strangers,</hi> &amp;c. In Building men uſe to lay the Foundation low, that ſo the Work may ſtand firm and ſure; and ſo muſt we lay our ſelves low before that Majeſty which is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, that our Reformation-work may hold it, when a ſound Humiliation lays the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it; that we remembring our way and our doings which have not been good, and loathing our ſinfull and polluted ſelves for all our abominations, our ſins of this king may not be had in remembrance againſt us, as the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were in the days of <hi>Joſiah, 2 King.</hi> 23. 26, 27. even to a <hi>decreee</hi> to <hi>remove Judah into Captivity.</hi> Though we enjoy as it were another <hi>Joſiah</hi> in our days, yet how deep in guilt the preceding Princes were, you cannot be ignorant: And the Judgments of God declaring againſt this ſin, you may diſcern, <hi>Amos 4. 11.
